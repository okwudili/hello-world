# hello-world
new project
Im okwudili but i have so many other names
just in case you see people calling me other names
AKA gelnux...
I'm addicted to writing code of all sort, don't know why doe.
I think it makes me fill i'm in charge, well ofcorse i'm.
When i'm capable of making, writing or telling something to do what i command it to
do, and it does it exactly like commanded...
That make me feel so superior.
why i don't like programming is i don't get to speak english, igbo, yoruba or spanish language to
things i command instead i speak crazy language like C++, Java, C#, Javascript, python, and some other web language
whic are logical language..Yeah not so bad doe.
